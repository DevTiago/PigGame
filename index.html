            <h3>GAME RULES:</h3>
            <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</p>
            <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes.
                Each result get added to his CURRENT score.</p>
            <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his CURRENT score gets lost.
                After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT
                score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next
                player's turn.</p>
            <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the
                game.</p>
                <p>Good Luck!</p>
